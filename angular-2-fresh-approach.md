Fresh approach to ui style

Front end developers are design implementers.

Why css shim?

View Encapsulation modes:

* Native
* None
* Emulated

CSS style in Angular emulated mode (to simulate Shadow DOM)

```
:host
```

```
:host-context
```

Either on the host element or from host parent element.
