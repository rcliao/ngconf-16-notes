# TypeScript + Angular

Maintain big JavaScript app is difficult and common problems across different companies.

Help catches simple JavaScript errors.

Steps to convert js to ts:

1. rename js to ts
2. moves js to src folder
3. Create `tsconfig.json`
4. Run tsc --watch to compile `.ts` to `.js`
5. Start defining interface to get better tooling (auto-complete, compile time error ... etc.)

## Roadmap for TypeScript 2.0

* Async/wait
* Read-only properties
* Specify type of `this` function
* Path mapping
 ... etc.
 
## Improved typing acquisitions

* Use npm to install type declaration packages

## Nullable types

undefined and null are their own type now.

To have nullable field: number|undefined
